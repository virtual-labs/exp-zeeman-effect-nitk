### Procedure

1. Select the "Magnetic Field vs. Current" procedure from the 'Select Procedure' dropdown menu.
2. Click on the 'Insert Hall probe' button to insert the probe into the electromagnet. The distance between    electromagnets should be 1 cm.
3. Click on the 'Add to Table' button to add current and magnetic field values to the table.
4. Click on the 'Observation' button to view the table.
5. Click on the 'plot graph' button to view the graph.
6. Change the procedure to "Zeeman Effect" to calculate the Bohr magneton.
7. Display the Optical rail with the converging lens, polarizer, Fabry Perot etalon (fix the thickness of air gap of etalon t= 4mm), a telescope with focussing lens, and a CCD camera on the rail with equal height in order to make the parallel light.
8. Click on the 'Insert mercury tube' button to insert the mercury discharge tube into the electromagnet.
9. Carefully adjust the distance between the individual components to get a clear image of the rings.
10. Connect the CCD camera to the Monitor and observe the concentric circular rings.
11. Click on the ‘Magnetic field’ button to apply the maximum magnetic field and observe the splitting of spectral lines.
12. Click on the ‘Take reading’ button to bring the innermost splitting of the first spectrum line at the cross-section and note down the micrometer reading. This position is Ri.
13. Click on the ‘Take reading’ button again to move the micrometer to adjust the second spectral splitting of the first line at the cross wire and note its reading.
14. Similarly, take readings of all the splitting in different spectral lines by keep on clicking the ‘Take reading button.
15. Click on the “observations’ button to display the observation table.
16. Click on the “calculation” button on the observation table to display the calculations.
17. Click on the “Show Result’ button to display the result.
