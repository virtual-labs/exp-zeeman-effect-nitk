### Theory

The Zeeman effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a magnetic field (B) is applied to a material and splits the spectral lines of an atom or molecule. This splitting of spectral lines occurs due to the interaction of the magnetic field with the electrons of the atom or molecule. The theory behind the Zeeman effect is based on the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment () of the electrons. The magnetic moment of an electron is proportional to its angular momentum and is caused by the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of the electron and its orbital angular momentum. In the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of the electrons are shifted due to the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the electrons. This interaction causes the energies of the electrons to split into two or more separate energy levels. The separation between the energy levels is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. When the electrons in an atom or molecule transition between these energy levels, they emit or absorb light, resulting in the characteristic spectral lines of the atom or molecule. The presence of a magnetic field causes the spectral lines to split into several separate lines, which is known as the Zeeman effect.

The Zeeman effect has many applications in various fields, including atomic spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the study of magnetic fields in stars and other astronomical objects.

Let us consider the transition corresponding to the 546.1 nm prominent green line of mercury spectrum with which we are concerned here. This line arises from a transition between the 3<sub>S<sub>1</sub></sub>(6s7s) state to 3<sub>p<sub>2</sub></sub>(6s6p) state.

Figure.1 shows the energy diagram for these two states without and with a magnetic field. The upper level gets split into three corresponding to m<sub>j</sub>=1,0, -1, and the lower into five corresponding to m<sub>j</sub>= 2,1,0,-1 and -2. The g-factors for the upper and lower states are

As shown in Figure.1, in the presence of the magnetic field, the 546.1 nm line gives rise to nine components. This is because of different g-factors for the initial and final states. This is a case of the anomalous Zeeman effect.

When viewed in the transverse geometry, (i) the first group where ∆m<sub>j</sub>=-1 gives <img src="images/sigma.png">- lines whose light is polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field, (ii) the middle group where ∆m<sub>j</sub>=0 gives <img src="images/pi.png">-lines whose light is polarized parallel to the direction of the field and (iii) the last group where ∆m<sub>j</sub>=1 gives <img src="images/sigma.png">– lines whose light is again polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field.

In the longitudinal geometry where the light beam is along the direction of the magnetic field, the beam corresponding to <img src="images/pi.png">-lines (has electric vector along the direction of the magnetic field) cannot travel as light waves are transverse electromagnetic waves. The beam corresponding to <img src="images/pi.png">-lines is therefore not observed. The beam corresponding to six  <img src="images/sigma.png">– lines is circularly polarized when viewed in the longitudinal direction, the three components corresponding to ∆m<sub>j</sub>=1 as left circularly polarized.The shift in frequencies of these nine lines is in the lower part of Figure 1 in units of  μ<sub>b</sub>/h. We are interested in the three <img src="images/pi.png">-lines for the measurement of Bohr magneton and use transverse geometry. These are picked up by a polarizer whose pass direction is kept parallel to the direction of the magnetic field. The <img src="images/sigma.png">– lines which are polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field get blocked. The frequencies of these three <img src="images/pi.png">-lines are

This frequency shift ∆υ= μ<sub>b</sub>B/2h= eB/8πm is measured in this experiment. As this is very small, a high-resolution device, a Fabry Perot etalon, based on multiple beam interferometry is used. The Fabry Perot etalon consists of two optically flat (to within 20 nm) glass plates coated on the inner surface with a partially transmitting metallic layer (reflection coefficient 0.95) (Figure 2).

</center>

The outer surface is slightly inclined (about 0.1<sup>0</sup>) with respect to the inner one, to avoid multiple reflections. The plates are arranged in a holder and held apart (with spacing t) by three very accurately machined spacers. Three spring-mounted screws are used to apply pressure, and by careful adjustment, the plates are made parallel. 

An almost parallel beam from an extended source at the focus of a lens falls on the etalon. The emerging parallel rays B. D. F, etc, are brought to focus by the use of a good quality lens of focal length f, as shown in Figure 3.

Light entering the etalon at an angle θ is focused onto a ring of radius fθ. When θ satisfies the condition,

The order of the first bright ring counting from the center is less than n<sub>0</sub>, since n<sub>1</sub>=n<sub>0</sub>cos θ<sub>1</sub>. 

Let us take n<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>0</sub> – ε with fractional order ε lying between zero and one. In general, for the p<sup>th</sup> ring of the pattern as measured from the center.

 From Eqs. (9) and (10) we obtain for the square of the radius of the p<sup>th</sup> ring

and the difference between the squares of the radii of adjacent rings
<center>
<img src="images/img31.png">----------(12)

This difference is constant. The squares of the radii of successive rings are linearly related and form an arithmetic progression.

Now if there are two components of a spectral line (in the present experiment, we have three components) with wavelengths λ<sub>a</sub>and λ<sub>b</sub> very close to one another, their fractional orders at the center will be given by

Here, <img src="images/vecVa.png"> and <img src="images/vecVb.png"> are wave numbers, and n<sub>1</sub>(a) and n<sub>1</sub>(b) are orders of the first rings. As the wavelengths are very close, n<sub>1</sub>(a)= n<sub>1</sub>(b). The difference in wave numbers between the two components is, therefore:

Consider a line which has three components (as in the present experiment) a, b, c, and let the respective radii be r<sub>1a</sub>, r<sub>2a</sub>, r<sub>3a</sub>, ...., for component a; r<sub>1b</sub>, r<sub>2b</sub>, r<sub>3b</sub>, ....,  for component b and similarly for component c. From Eq. (12), it is clear that the difference between the squares of the radii of any two adjacent rings of component a

and the required separation (in wave numbers) between the two components, a and b, using Eq.(13), is given by
<center>
<img src="images/img41.png">----------(15)
</center>

The difference <img src="images/delta.png"> between the squares of the radii of the p<sup>th</sup> rings of components a and b is found to be independent of p. We shall take the average of these. Let these be designated by δ. The required separation between the two components is finally given by

As the result depends on the ratio of δ<sub>ab</sub>/∆, the dimensions used in measuring the radii of the ring system or the amplification of the interference pattern do not matter. Using this wave number separation in Eq. 8 for the Zeeman line splitting, we get
